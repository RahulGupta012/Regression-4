    "Lassso regression is a feature selcting regression , which make those feature value zero, which are very low correlated to the dependent feature. It is also called L1 Regulazation and penalized regression method. Lasso regression is known for increasing the predction accuracy of the model. It is differ from the other regressions as Ridge... because that specific regression is focused on reducing the overfitting (in some cases feature selection also) only while the lasso regression has the ability feature selection and overfitting.\n",
